# AllStar Time & Weather Announcer

This Python script speaks the current time, date, and weather conditions over your AllStar node using `asl-tts`. It pulls live data from the National Weather Service (NWS) and adapts its message based on time of day â€” including highs and lows in the morning, and humidity when relevant.
